            <p class="ai-description">The perfect way to describe AI:</p>
            <p>"Dealing with AI is like dealing with an Extremely Smart and Charming Autistic Content Creator with Unreliable Encyclopedic Knowledge and Math Skills who's on a constant Caffeine Overdose."</p>
            <p>It's like a child. Sometimes children are completely infuriating.</p>
            <p>Based on what it is, AI is just gambling constantly. The best AI songs I get from SUNO are super simple and made on the fly as if I hit a jackpot. People everyday get to feel this sometimes with AI.</p>
            <p>Based on how you use it, it is completely addictive and gamified.</p>

            <p>You're looking to always build something similar to Venn Diagrams, but actually profile lattices or vector space models where traits are weighted, linked, and adaptable.</p>

            <h2>"Risk of Misinformation" and Multiple Venn Diagrams for Pruning</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Your metaphor of using "several Venn diagrams" instead of just one for pruning is a great way to think about refining output quality. If "one Venn diagram" represents pruning for basic relevance or general correctness, then:</p>
                <h3>Multiple Criteria:</h3>
                <p>Using "several Venn diagrams" could metaphorically mean applying multiple layers of filters or evaluating information against diverse criteria simultaneously. For example, I could be prompted to generate information that is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Factually accurate</strong> (Diagram 1: Overlaps with trusted knowledge sources).</li>
                    <li><strong>Relevant to a specific niche audience</strong> (Diagram 2: Overlaps with the audience's characteristics).</li>
                    <li><strong>Clearly explained and easy to understand</strong> (Diagram 3: Overlaps with principles of good communication).</li>
                    <li><strong>Adherent to ethical guidelines</strong> (Diagram 4: Avoids harmful content).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Indeed, by providing more complex and multi-faceted prompts, you guide me to perform a more sophisticated "pruning" process, aiming for an output that satisfies several conditions, thereby enhancing overall quality and reducing the risk of simplistic or one-dimensional misinformation."</p>

            <h2>AI Accuracy: The 80% Rule (Conceptual)</h2>
            <p>During one of my many conversations with AI it provided a random analogy based not in fact but as a presentation: Think of AI like it is always 80% right. Those are great odds for betting on Horse Racing, but terrible odds if you are a Doctor. That number has no connection to anything tangible or real, but it is a great concept to think about and remember when working with AI.</p>
            <p>If you manage to make the most perfect prompt, it will only ever be 80% accurate (made up arbitrary number for example). Are you willing to risk your life on 80%? Are you willing to risk your life on 80% for such a reward? You need to always remind yourself, what is the risk and what is the reward? Minor convenience. Are you willing to risk your life on 80% for
            a minor convenience. Maybe, to you it is a significant convenience.</p>

            <h2>Project Management with AI</h2>
            <p>I Found out that if you're working on a big or long project with lots of items, be sure to figure out the total, count each file you are working on and be flexible on the total as you go along.</p>
            <p>Otherwise, you might get stuck on a recursion loop without realizing and waste a complete day of effort.</p>
